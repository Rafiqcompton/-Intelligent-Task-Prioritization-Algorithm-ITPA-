Intelligent Task Prioritization Algorithm (ITPA)

Description:
ITPA is an algorithm that optimizes task prioritization based on various factors such as deadlines, dependencies, importance, and individual productivity. It analyzes historical data and adapts over time to improve productivity and task completion efficiency.

Usage:
1. Define a list of tasks and individuals.
2. Call the "intelligentTaskPrioritization" function with the tasks and individuals as parameters.
3. The algorithm will calculate individual productivity metrics and assign priorities to tasks.
4. The tasks will be sorted in descending order of priority.
5. Execute the tasks according to the assigned priority.

Note:
Make sure to provide relevant data and customize the "calculateProductivity" and "calculatePriority" functions according to your specific requirements.
