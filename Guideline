Start by defining a list of tasks and individuals.
Ensure that the tasks have attributes such as deadlines, dependencies, and importance, while individuals have productivity-related metrics.
Customize the "calculateProductivity" function to calculate individual productivity based on relevant factors, such as historical data, skills, and availability.
Customize the "calculatePriority" function to assign priority to tasks based on factors like deadlines, dependencies, importance, and individual productivity.
Call the "intelligentTaskPrioritization" function with the tasks and individuals as parameters.
The algorithm will calculate individual productivity metrics and assign priorities to tasks.
The tasks will be sorted in descending order of priority.
Execute the tasks according to the assigned priority, considering the other relevant factors like resource availability and task dependencies.
